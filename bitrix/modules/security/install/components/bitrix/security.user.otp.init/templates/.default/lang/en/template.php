are tools that a malicious user can employ to get into your computer and steal these data.

Bitrix24 is now powered with two-step authentication, a special method for protecting against hacker software.  You are strongly recommended to enable this 
new option for better security. 
<br/><br/>
Two-step authentication means that a user will have to pass two level of verification. First, users enter their passwords. Next they have to enter a one-time 
security code sent to their mobile device each time they authorize.
